A python script used to monitor and reset on hash drop while using the stak miner when mining with Vega's

This is just a basic python replacement for JJ's script.

As it stands you will have to manually modify the reset graphics function to reflect your setup just as you have to do with JJ's script.

If I get more interest I will clean this up and possibly even add a gui to make it look pretty.


If you want to throw some monero at me:
